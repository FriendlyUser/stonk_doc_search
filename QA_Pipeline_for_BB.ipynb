With today\\'s announced collaborative agreement, Ping An will leverage Peak\\'s Heartbeat insurance platform, which is connected to over 300 car dealerships throughout China, to offer insurance policies specifically designed for the auto industry.\\nPeak Fintech Group Inc. is the parent company of a group of innovative financial technology (Fintech) subsidiaries operating primarily in the commercial lending industry.

In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months from the end of the reporting period. The use of these principles may not be appropriate.\\nThe level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the Company\\'s working capital requirements. The Company\\'s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, the Company incurred a net loss of $93,631 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (year ended December 31, 2020 - $5,513,511), it has an accumulated deficit of $31,025,562 as at June 30, 2021 ($30,240,372 as at December 31, 2020) and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. Until that happens, the company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whatever initiatives it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financial obligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company\\'s ability to continue as a going concern.\\nThe World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since that time, businesses all over the world from a wide swath of industries have seen their operations negatively impacted by the health and safety measures, including limitations on the movement of goods and individuals, put into place by local governments to help control the spread of the outbreak. Although those measures have been relaxed in recent months, which has allowed many businesses, including the Company, to slowly resume their operations, there still remains a great deal of uncertainty as to the extent and duration of the future impact of COVID-19 on global commerce and the Company\\'s business.\\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments or disclosures that may be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. If this were the case, these adjustments could be material.\\n3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nStatement of compliance with IFRS\\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, have been prepared in accordance with the International Accounting Standard 34, Interim Financial Reporting (\\'\\'IAS 34\\'\\').

(\"ASSI\") as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company\\'s Asia Synergy Data Solutions (\"ASDS\") subsidiary. ASSI was created to allow the Company to provide services related to the selling and distribution of property and liability insurance products in China. As a result, ASDS owns 100% interest in ASSI.\\nAll the subsidiaries have December 31 financial year-end dates and are incorporated in either Canada, Hong Kong or China. All intercompany transactions and accounts were eliminated upon consolidation, including unrealized gains or losses on intercompany transactions. Where unrealized losses on intercompany asset sales are reversed upon consolidation, the underlying asset is also tested for impairment from the Company\\'s perspective. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company.\\nProfit or loss of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are recognized from the effective date of acquisition, or up to the effective date of disposal, as applicable.\\nFunctional and presentation currency\\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is also the functional currency of the parent company.\\nNew Standards adopted as at January 1, 2021\\nSome accounting pronouncements which have become effective from January 1, 2021, and have therefore been adopted do not have a significant impact on the Company financial results or position.\\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company, through its Asia Synergy Credit Solutions (\"ASCS\") subsidiary, transferred certain assets and personnel from Wuxi Wenyi Financial Services Co. (\"Wenyi\") to ASSC. Wenyi offers turn-key credit outsourcing services to banks and other lending institutions in China. The asset transfer was made to enhance the Company position in the commercial lending market in China. The assets acquired were intangible assets consisting of loan-servicing agreements. The assets acquired were determined to constitute a business combination and, accordingly, the acquisition was be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.\\nThe purchase price payable for this acquisition was to be settled with the issuance of up a maximum of 2,000,000 common shares of the Company. The final value of consideration payable was contingent on achievement by ASCS of certain financial performance metrics during its first 18 months of operations. In the event that 2,000,000 shares were to be issued after the 18-month period and the listed common share price of the Company was less than $1.00 at that time, the Company was to issue additional shares to bring the aggregate consideration value to $2,000,000.\\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\\n4 - BUSINESS COMBINATION (CONTINUED)\\nAs at June 30, 2020, the 18 month performance period concluded and based on actual results of ASCS the final contingent consideration payable was settled at $530,675. As per the asset transfer agreement, the total number of shares issuable to settle the consideration totaled 1,340,000 at an average issue price of $0.40 per share.\\nOn November 11, 2020, the Company issued 317,663 common shares of the Company, at $0,40 per share, in part settlement ($127,065) of the consideration payable under the asset transfer agreement. On April 8, 2021, the Company issued the final tranche of shares under the agreement (1,022,337 at $0,40 per share totaling $403,610). As at June 30, 2021, the consideration remaining payable under the agreement totaled $Nil (December 31, 2020 - $403,610).\\n5 - LOANS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\\nThe Company\\'s Asia Synergy Financial Capital (\"ASFC\") subsidiary provides various financial services to small and medium size enterprises and entrepreneurs in China, including loans.\\nASFC\\'s loans are either guaranteed by a third party and/or collateral assets. The loans secured with collateral are either secured by used vehicles or by the residential properties of the borrowers. Loans that are not guaranteed by collateral assets are insured by a third party.\\nLoans guaranteed by used vehicles.\\nThe used vehicles are valued by ASFC\\'s credit department before approving a loan. The loan value at inception represents typically between 50% to 80% of the collateral value with an average of 78% as at June 30, 2021 (78% as at December 31, 2020). The used vehicles\\' collateral value are evaluated at the beginning of the loans and periodically during the life of the loans, based on an industry recognized used car guide which has been validated by ASFC personnel, their knowledge, experience and the inspection process before approval of the loans.\\nLoans guaranteed by second rank mortgage on residential property\\nBefore approving a loan, ASFC\\'s credit department will assess the value of any other mortgages taken out on the residential property and put as collateral by the prospective borrower. The loan value at inception typically represents between 25% and 32% of the collateral value exceeding the first rank mortgage taken by the borrower. The value of the residential property is evaluated at the beginning of the loan and periodically during the life of the loan based on a residential broker site, which is validated by ASFC personnel, their knowledge, experience and inspection process before approval of the loan.\\nAll the loans secured by collateral assets are registered on the appropriate government regulated system.\\nCredit Loans guaranteed by a third party\\nASFC makes loans to small and medium enterprises in the technology sector through the Company\\'s Business Hub. Before approving a loan, ASFC relies on the credit evaluation of the borrower. The credit evaluation includes: the borrower\\' company\\'s credit profile, operating performance, financial statements, tax payments/receipt records, shareholders\\' structure and their individual credit ratings. Based on the result of this initial evaluation, ASFC will then proceed to sign a loan agreement with the SME borrowers. To mitigate the default risk in the case of any overdue situation incurred regarding the loans, a letter of guarantee must also be signed before a loan is finally granted to SME borrowers. Accordingly, a 3rd party must accept to provide a full guarantee to cover any overdue principal and interest on behalf of the borrowers. ASFC will also perform on-going monitoring of SMEs borrowers in the tech industry through the Business Hub app, visits, phone calls and follow- up on business models development.\\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\\n5 - LOANS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)\\nFor the majority of loans granted, principal and interest are payable by the borrower on a monthly basis.\\nLoans receivables are described as follows :\\nPrincipal balance loans receivables Less expected credit loss (ECL) Loan receivables net\\nLoans receivables maturing in less than 12 months Loans receivables maturing in more than 12 months Total loans\\nImpaired loans and allowances for credit loss\\nThe Company performed a three-stage forward looking impairment approach to its loan portfolio to measure the expected credit loss as described in detail in note 4.11 of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nThe following table presents the gross carrying amount of loans receivables at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , according to credit quality and ECL impairment stages.\\nECL is calculated on loan value at the period end that are not insured by a third party with an assumption of a credit loss allocation provision applied as follows:\\nStage 1 : 1% Stage 2: 30% Stage 3 :100%\\nCredit loss allocation applied - Auto\\nallocation applied Residential Property\\nStage 1 Not overdue <= 30 Days Stage 2 Overdue 3090 days Stage 3 Overdue> 90 days Total\\nGross Carrying amount $ 18 430 566 35 010 3 124 592 21 590 169\\nAllowance for credit loss $ (288 736)  (284 932) (573 668)\\nNet Carrying Amount $ 18 141 830 35 010 2 839 661 21 016 501\\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\\n5 - LOANS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)\\nStage 1 Not overdue <= 30 Days Stage 2 Overdue 3090 days Stage 3 Overdue> 90 days Total\\nGross Carrying amount $ 15 652 125 1 110 537 3 246 443 20 009 105\\nAllowance for credit loss $ (224 798) (3 332) (356 287) (584 417)\\nNet Carrying Amount $ 15 427 327 1 107 205 2 890 156 19 424 688\\nThe loss allowance for loans to customers as at June 30, 2021, broken down by product type, reconciles to the opening loss allowance for that provision as follows:\\nLoss allowance as at December 31, 2020 Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 2 (lifetime expected credit losses) Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 3 Credit-impaired financial assets New financial assets originated Write-offs Recoveries Change in Credit loss allocation + ECL % assumption Foreign exchange\\n(193 854) (42 607) 144 291 16 412\\nLoss allowance as at June 30, 2021\\nProduct Type - Residential property\\nLoss allowance as at December 31, 2020 Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 2 (lifetime expected credit losses) Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 3 Credit-impaired financial assets New financial assets originated Write-offs Recoveries Change in Credit loss allocation + ECL % assumption Foreign exchange\\nLoss allowance as at June 30, 2021\\n\\x0cPEAK FINTECH GROUP INC.
