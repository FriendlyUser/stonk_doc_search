(hereinafter \\'\\'Peak\\'\\' or the \"Company\") was incorporated pursuant to the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) on May 13, 2008, and continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act on April 4, 2011. Peak Fintech Group Inc.\\'s executive offices are located at 550 Sherbrooke Street West, Suite 265, Montral, Qubec, Canada. Its shares are traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange (CSE) under the symbol \"PKK\". Its shares are quoted in the U.S. on the OTC Market\\'s Groups (OTCQX) under the symbol \\'\\'PKKFF\\'\\'.\\nPeak is the parent company of a group of innovative financial technology (Fintech) subsidiaries operating primarily in the commercial lending industry. Peak\\'s subsidiaries bring together lending financial institutions and businesses to create the Cubeler Business Hub, an ecosystem where analytics and artificial intelligence are used to facilitate transactions among members of the ecosystem.\\n2 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY AND COVID-19\\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assume that the Company will continue in operation and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but not limited to twelve months from the end of the reporting period. The use of these principles may not be appropriate.\\nThe level of revenue currently being generated is not presently sufficient to meet the Company\\'s working capital requirements. The Company\\'s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional financing. Even if the Company has been successful in the past in doing so, there is no assurance that it will manage to obtain additional financing in the future. Also, the Company incurred a net loss of $93,631 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 (year ended December 31, 2020 - $5,513,511), it has an accumulated deficit of $31,025,562 as at June 30, 2021 ($30,240,372 as at December 31, 2020) and it has not yet generated positive cash flows from operations on a regular basis. Until that happens, the company will continue to assess its working capital needs and undertake whatever initiatives it deems necessary to ensure that it continues to be in a position to meet its financial obligations. These material uncertainties cast significant doubt regarding the Company\\'s ability to continue as a going concern.\\nThe World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. Since that time, businesses all over the world from a wide swath of industries have seen their operations negatively impacted by the health and safety measures, including limitations on the movement of goods and individuals, put into place by local governments to help control the spread of the outbreak. Although those measures have been relaxed in recent months, which has allowed many businesses, including the Company, to slowly resume their operations, there still remains a great deal of uncertainty as to the extent and duration of the future impact of COVID-19 on global commerce and the Company\\'s business.\\nThese condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments or disclosures that may be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern.

The loans secured with collateral are either secured by used vehicles or by the residential properties of the borrowers. Loans that are not guaranteed by collateral assets are insured by a third party.\\nLoans guaranteed by used vehicles.\\nThe used vehicles are valued by ASFC\\'s credit department before approving a loan. The loan value at inception represents typically between 50% to 80% of the collateral value with an average of 78% as at June 30, 2021 (78% as at December 31, 2020). The used vehicles\\' collateral value are evaluated at the beginning of the loans and periodically during the life of the loans, based on an industry recognized used car guide which has been validated by ASFC personnel, their knowledge, experience and the inspection process before approval of the loans.\\nLoans guaranteed by second rank mortgage on residential property\\nBefore approving a loan, ASFC\\'s credit department will assess the value of any other mortgages taken out on the residential property and put as collateral by the prospective borrower. The loan value at inception typically represents between 25% and 32% of the collateral value exceeding the first rank mortgage taken by the borrower.

Before approving a loan, ASFC relies on the credit evaluation of the borrower. The credit evaluation includes: the borrower\\' company\\'s credit profile, operating performance, financial statements, tax payments/receipt records, shareholders\\' structure and their individual credit ratings. Based on the result of this initial evaluation, ASFC will then proceed to sign a loan agreement with the SME borrowers. To mitigate the default risk in the case of any overdue situation incurred regarding the loans, a letter of guarantee must also be signed before a loan is finally granted to SME borrowers. Accordingly, a 3rd party must accept to provide a full guarantee to cover any overdue principal and interest on behalf of the borrowers. ASFC will also perform on-going monitoring of SMEs borrowers in the tech industry through the Business Hub app, visits, phone calls and follow- up on business models development.\\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\\n5 - LOANS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)\\nFor the majority of loans granted, principal and interest are payable by the borrower on a monthly basis.\\nLoans receivables are described as follows :\\nPrincipal balance loans receivables Less expected credit loss (ECL) Loan receivables net\\nLoans receivables maturing in less than 12 months Loans receivables maturing in more than 12 months Total loans\\nImpaired loans and allowances for credit loss\\nThe Company performed a three-stage forward looking impairment approach to its loan portfolio to measure the expected credit loss as described in detail in note 4.11 of the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\\nThe following table presents the gross carrying amount of loans receivables at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , according to credit quality and ECL impairment stages.\\nECL is calculated on loan value at the period end that are not insured by a third party with an assumption of a credit loss allocation provision applied as follows:\\nStage 1 : 1% Stage 2: 30% Stage 3 :100%\\nCredit loss allocation applied - Auto\\nallocation applied Residential Property\\nStage 1 Not overdue <= 30 Days Stage 2 Overdue 3090 days Stage 3 Overdue> 90 days Total\\nGross Carrying amount $ 18 430 566 35 010 3 124 592 21 590 169\\nAllowance for credit loss $ (288 736)  (284 932) (573 668)\\nNet Carrying Amount $ 18 141 830 35 010 2 839 661 21 016 501\\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\\nFor the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020\\n5 - LOANS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CONTINUED)\\nStage 1 Not overdue <= 30 Days Stage 2 Overdue 3090 days Stage 3 Overdue> 90 days Total\\nGross Carrying amount $ 15 652 125 1 110 537 3 246 443 20 009 105\\nAllowance for credit loss $ (224 798) (3 332) (356 287) (584 417)\\nNet Carrying Amount $ 15 427 327 1 107 205 2 890 156 19 424 688\\nThe loss allowance for loans to customers as at June 30, 2021, broken down by product type, reconciles to the opening loss allowance for that provision as follows:\\nLoss allowance as at December 31, 2020 Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 2 (lifetime expected credit losses) Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 3 Credit-impaired financial assets New financial assets originated Write-offs Recoveries Change in Credit loss allocation + ECL % assumption Foreign exchange\\n(193 854) (42 607) 144 291 16 412\\nLoss allowance as at June 30, 2021\\nProduct Type - Residential property\\nLoss allowance as at December 31, 2020 Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 2 (lifetime expected credit losses) Individual financial assets transferred to (from) stage 3 Credit-impaired financial assets New financial assets originated Write-offs Recoveries Change in Credit loss allocation + ECL % assumption Foreign exchange\\nLoss allowance as at June 30, 2021\\n\\x0cPEAK FINTECH GROUP INC.

(CSE: PKK) (\"Peak\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative Fintech service provider and manager of the Cubeler Business Hub, today announced that it has signed an exclusive partnership agreement with pre-owned vehicle trading platform YouCKU to provide YouCKU with after sale used car warranty policies, extended warranty policies and on-site vehicle repair and replacement policies.\\nYouCKU (https://www.youcku.com/) is one of China\\'s largest pre-owned vehicle trading platforms with over 42,000 affiliated car dealers, 87 physical delivery centres, servicing more than 240 cities in almost every province and region in China. In addition to providing a platform for vehicle owners to sell their vehicles, YouCKU also provides residual value consulting, helps car rental companies manage their vehicle replacement cycles and place regular orders to the OEMs, as well as assist downstream car dealers with stable vehicle sources. What distinguishes YouCKU from other platforms is the use of AI and a self-developed big data system to provide its services, something that not only contributed to today\\'s announced partnership with Peak, but also captured the attention of global investment firm Cathay Capital (https://www.cathaycapital.com/), who made a significant investment in YouCKU in November 2020.\\n\"The investment obtained from Cathay last year really helped us on the R&D front,\" commented YouCKU Founder and CEO Tianshi Shen. \"We believe that our value differentiator will continue to follow our emphasis on AI and big data. So naturally we jumped at this opportunity to work with the Peak group, which also leverages big data and AI to complement our service offering and allow us to efficiently deliver more value to our clients and stakeholders,\" concluded Mr. Shen.\\nThe partnership agreement between YouCKU and Peak is the first that is directly linked to Peak\\'s recent acquisition of the Heartbeat Insurance platform, through which Peak\\'s services will be provided to YouCKU. Under the terms of the agreement, each vehicle sold through the YouCKU platform will include a basic extended warranty policy with the option to add more coverage, which will be suggested to clients based on data analyzed by the platform. YouCKU expects to sell about 3,000 vehicles per month by the end of 2021 and at least double that amount by the end of 2022.\\n\"We really admire what YouCKU has done and how the company has been able to use AI and analytics to transform the pre-owned vehicle market in China,\" said Peak China CEO Liang Qiu. \"We believe there are tremendous opportunities here for us to work together and not just on the insurance products. With everything else our Business Hub has to offer, what YouCKU is already doing in the pre-owned vehicle space and our combined abilities to leverage AI and the massive amount of data that will be at our disposal, we believe we can develop a business model that not only impacts the Chinese market, but one that could be replicated in other pre-owned vehicle markets around the world.\"\\nPeak Fintech Group Inc. is the parent company of a group of innovative financial technology (Fintech) subsidiaries operating primarily in the commercial lending industry.

(CSE: PKK) (OTCQX: PKKFF) (\"Peak\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative Fintech service provider to the Chinese commercial lending sector, today announced that it has acquired a minority stake in China UnionPay subsidiary Rongbang Technology Ltd. (\"Rongbang\").\\nEarlier this year, Peak signed an agreement with Rongbang that allows Peak to use the China UnionPay network to provide fund transfer and payment settlement services within its Lending Hub ecosystem. After working closely with Rongbang (https://www.masget.com/) to connect to the UnionPay (http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/) network and implement the services, Peak commenced a small pilot project with a few select clients in May 2021 to test the services with live transactions before making them available at large to all its ecosystem members. The level of payment settlement and fund transfer activity picked up considerably in June with over 1,200 transactions during the month. This strong debut caught the attention of executives at both Rongbang and UnionPay who followed up with a visit to the Company\\'s head office in Wuxi. Following the meeting, Peak was issued an invitation to become a minority shareholder in Rongbang paving the way for greater collaboration between the three entities.\\nPeak invested 2.5M RMB (about CAD$500,000) for less than a 1% stake in Rongbang, yet the Company views the investment as a strategic marketing and business development investment rather than what would be considered a traditional minority investment in a private company. \"We could have spent over a million dollars on marketing and promotional initiatives and not received a fraction of the return we\\'ll be securing on this investment,\" commented Peak CEO Johnson Joseph. \"We are honored to now be part of a very exclusive group of shareholders led by UnionPay and China Datang (http://www.china-cdt.com/).

Cubeler leverages the data collected throughout its ecosystem to develop and commercialize a series of analytics and AI-based applications.\\n\"This acquisition is without a doubt the most important transaction in our Company\\'s history,\" commented Peak CEO Johnson Joseph. \"It not only gives us complete autonomy on the technology responsible for generating 90% of our revenue, but just as important, allows us to begin the next phase of our vision for the Business Hub, which is to create a global ecosystem of businesses and financial institutions where analytics and AI are used to conduct business more efficiently. Although Cubeler hasn\\'t officially launched its ecosystem in Canada, there are already small businesses from a wide range of industries and from every province, except for PEI, pre-registered on the platform. Our goal is to take elements from our operations in China, such as our ability to control the flow of funds to help our members get paid faster, and integrate this operational model within Cubeler\\'s ecosystem to create a North American Business Hub that provides members with the best of both worlds when we officially launch our North American operations later this year. We also plan on borrowing and implementing elements of Cubeler\\'s current ecosystem, such as the networking and advertising opportunities it provides, to our Business Hub in China, which already has thousands of members, to generate new revenue streams from our Chinese operations. Again, the vision is to eventually replicate the Business Hub concept in other parts of the world and allow all members of a then global network of businesses to connect with one another and remove, wherever possible, all geographic barriers and allow small businesses to leverage AI and the Hub to conduct business on a global scale,\" concluded Mr. Joseph.\\nAs the acquisition of Cubeler and expansion to North America are expected to have a significant impact on its future revenue, Peak will revise the revenue guidance it issued on July 20, 2021 immediately following the closing of the transaction.\\nPeak will acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cubeler from Cubeler\\'s shareholders in exchange for $1,000,000 in cash and 11,133,326 common shares of Peak, which will represent approximately 10% of Peak\\'s issued and outstanding common shares on a fully-diluted basis following the closing of the transaction (the \"Acquisition\"). The Peak common shares received by Cubeler\\'s shareholders will initially be restricted for a four-month period, following which 50% of the shares will be free-trading and the remaining 50% will be released and become free-trading over a two-year period on the anniversary date of the Acquisition. The Acquisition is expected to close on or prior to September 30, 2021, pending a fairness opinion from an independent third-party.\\nThe Acquisition is expected to constitute a \"related party transaction\", as defined within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (\"MI 61-101\"), as Johnson Joseph, Chief Executive Officer and director of Peak; Liang Qiu, director of Peak; Jean Landreville, Chief Financial Officer of Peak; Charles-Andr Tessier, director of Peak; and Mark Dumas, director of Peak (collectively the \"Related Parties\"), are all shareholders of Cubeler. The Acquisition will be exempt from (i) the formal valuation requirements of Section 5.4 of MI 61-101 by virtue of Subsection\\n\\x0c5.5(a) of MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirements of Section 5.6 of MI 61-101 by virtue of Subsection 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101 on the basis that the fair market value of the consideration to be received by the Related Parties shall not exceed an amount equal to 25% of Peak\\'s market capitalization.\\nAbout Peak Fintech Group Inc.: Peak Fintech Group Inc. is the parent company of a group of innovative financial technology (Fintech) subsidiaries operating primarily in the commercial lending industry.

(CSE: PKK) (OTCQX: PKKFF) (\"Peak\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative Fintech service provider to the Chinese commercial lending sector, today announced that its Cubeler Lending Hub and Gold River platforms are now linked to the China UnionPay network through direct API links, allowing the Company to process payments, settle transactions and transfer funds between lending institutions, banks and the businesses that are part of its Lending Hub ecosystem.\\nChina UnionPay (http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/) is a State-owned entity and China\\'s largest POS electronic funds transfer network. It\\'s also the only interbank network in China that links all the automatic teller machines (ATMs) of all banks throughout the country. According to Wikipedia, UnionPay is the largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined) in the world, ahead of Visa and Mastercard.\\nDuring the month of June 2021, 117 Lending Hub registered businesses created virtual bank accounts within the ecosystem. Over that same period, the Company processed more than 1,200 fund transfer and payment settlement transactions in and out of those virtual bank accounts for an approximate amount of CAD$300,000,000. While part of those funds were transferred to real bank accounts held outside of the Company\\'s ecosystem, the majority of the funds were still held in virtual bank accounts within the Lending Hub ecosystem at the end of the month. Peak receives a 1.5% annual fee, calculated and paid daily, from UnionPay on the aggregate value of the funds held in the Lending Hub\\'s virtual bank accounts. The Company has implemented a policy that requires all new Lending Hub members to have virtual bank accounts within the ecosystem, where the proceeds of loans and credit for which they qualify will first be held until the funds are used for the intended purpose they were obtained.\\nGrant of Stock Options to Directors, Officers and Key Employees\\nPeak also announced that it has granted a total of 1,650,000 incentive stock options to certain directors, officers and key employees of the Company. The stock option grant is Peak\\'s way of acknowledging the efforts of its directors, officers and key employees, both in China and in Canada, that have led to the recent closing of the Company\\'s $52M short-form prospectus financing. The stock options will expire in July 2026, vest over a 2-year period and have an exercise price of $2.05.\\nPeak Fintech Group Inc. is the parent company of a group of innovative financial technology (Fintech) subsidiaries operating in China\\'s commercial lending industry.

JD.com, for example, reported sales of USD$38B for 618 in 2020. By comparison, Cyber Monday 2020, which included the combined sales of all US online retailers, generated sales of USD$10.7B, making it the biggest shopping day in US history.\\n\"To be able to offer the deals to attract consumers to 618, retailers on marketplaces like Alibaba\\'s T-Mall or JD.com must make sure they are able to meet any financing demand created by the event,\" commented Shen Rao, Chief Operating Officer at Peak\\'s Asia Synergy Technologies subsidiary. \"We worked with JD.com retailers and suppliers for almost two months leading up to the event to get them acclimated with our recently launched retailer and distributor financing programs and help provide them with the cash flow flexibility they would need to get the most out of this year\\'s 618.\"\\nAccording to WPIC Marketing + Technologies, this year\\'s 618 event broke several records as more and more people were introduced to online shopping in the past 18 months due to COVID-19. JD.com alone reported sales of 343B RMB (about USD$53B) on its marketplace during the event, an increase of 39.5% compared to last year. According to China Internet Watch, the largest order volume on JD.com came from the province of Jiangsu, which is the province where Peak\\'s Chinese headquarters is located.\\nIn its first year of participating in 618, Peak helped JD.com retailers and suppliers finance 789 transactions worth a combined 1.05B RMB (approximately CAD$200M).
